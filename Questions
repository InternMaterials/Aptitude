# FORMULA

-> If the ratio of the speeds of A and B is a : b, then the ratio of
the times taken by them to cover the same distance is	1/a	:	1/b	or b : a.

-> Suppose a man covers a certain distance at x km/hr and an equal distance at y km/hr. Then,
the average speed during the whole journey is		2xy/(x + y)		km/hr.


# QUESTIONS:

1. A man covered a certain distance at some speed. Had he moved 3 kmph faster, he would have taken 40 minutes less. If he had moved 2 kmph slower, he would have taken 40 minutes more. The distance (in km) is:

Let distance = x km and usual rate = y kmph.

Then,	x	-	x	=	40	     2y(y + 3) = 9x ....(i)
y	y + 3	60
And,	x	-	x	=	40	     y(y - 2) = 3x ....(ii)
y -2	y	60
On dividing (i) by (ii), we get: x = 40.

2. A man complete a journey in 10 hours. He travels first half of the journey at the rate of 21 km/hr and second half at the rate of 24 km/hr. Find the total journey in km.

((1/2)x)/21 +	((1/2)x)24	= 10

	x/21	+	x/24	= 20

 15x = 168 x 20

 x =		168 x 20/15		= 224 km.

3. Excluding stoppages, the speed of a bus is 54 kmph and including stoppages, it is 45 kmph. For how many minutes does the bus stop per hour?

Due to stoppages, it covers 9 km less.

Time taken to cover 9 km =		9/54	x 60	min	= 10 min.


4. Two cars pass each other in opposite direction. How long would they take to be 500 km apart?

I.The sum of their speeds is 135 km/hr.

II. The difference of their speed is 25 km/hr.

A.	I alone sufficient while II alone not sufficient to answer
B.	II alone sufficient while I alone not sufficient to answer
C.	Either I or II alone sufficient to answer
D.	Both I and II are not sufficient to answer
E.	Both I and II are necessary to answer
Answer: Option A

Explanation:

I gives, relative speed = 135 km/hr.

 Time taken =	500/135	hrs.

II does not give the relative speed.

 I alone gives the answer and II is irrelevant.

 Correct answer is (A).
